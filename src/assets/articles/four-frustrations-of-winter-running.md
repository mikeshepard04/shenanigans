It's the end of November and there is snow on the ground. I just completed my 14 mile run yesterday and looking forward to ramping up to 16 miles next week. As I am excited to try something new I am also regretting my decision to run a winter marathon. Mainly because I hate the cold. That being said, this week I am going to list 4 things that have frustrated me so far during my winter marathon training.

### 1. What to wear.
Seriously, why is this so difficult? I have looked at blog after blog to see what people recommend and the thing is it really depends on the person. They main trend I see is dress for 20 degrees warmer. Which makes sense, but because I work inside all day and the only time I am outside is when I am running, this is difficult for me to imagine. I also tend to over-dress because I hate being cold, so that doesn’t really help me either.

On my run yesterday it was about 35-40 degrees and sunny so it was a perfect day. I went out with compression socks, medium warm leggings, a dry fit t-shirt, and a cotton long sleeve shirt. No gloves or hat. I would end up getting hot and take off the long sleeve and then my arms would get cold so I would put it back on which is why layers are amazing.

Lesson learned: Layers are your best friend. It’s better to have more than you need than not enough. I would also invest in good socks. Wool is preferred for those really cold days since it's better for your feet to be warm, but if they start to sweat you don’t want them to get cold later. If you really aren’t sure about weather conditions and what you are wearing, start your first few miles near your home so you can discard or get additional clothes.

### 2. Timing

My husband and I are always doing something. We have our weekends booked out through the end of December and since the weekends are when I get my long runs in, I have to plan ahead. I look at the weather and what we are doing for that weekend to pick the best time to lace up.

Right now I am reviewing next weekend and it doesn’t look great – freezing rain and an Iowa State football game on Saturday and snow on Sunday. Since injury isn’t an option I might take some dreadmill (treadmill) miles over the weekend.

Lessons learned: Using your phone calendar to schedule your runs and stick to it. Rule number one is never break a promise to yourself. We are imperfect people, but letting ourselves down shouldn’t be an option. If something comes up always make sure you re-schedule with yourself. I also recommend having something to do after your run that you will look forward.

### 3. Pace.

My first few long runs haven’t been ideal. But really, long runs aren’t for pace, they are for distance (I remind myself this constantly). It's so easy to judge your fitness by your mile pace. How else can you judge how the run went? Or am I improving or getting faster? Winter training might discourage runners since they aren’t seeing that improvement immediately, but if you look what your body is doing week after week is quite amazing.

Lessons learned: Don’t only head outside for your long runs, make sure to schedule shorter runs or track workouts. This should help you see some improvement and might even help you get used to the cold.

### 4. Winter Running Clothes.

This might seem repetitive, but as I have been researching/looking for cold running gear they are both expensive and I question how warm they actually are. As I have already identified I am a baby when it comes to cold weather, so if I am going to spend money on something it better be up to my warmth standards. I have to say, reviewing these items are time consuming and irritating. One thing I have been looking for is a full zip jacket that would be warm, wind and rain repellent as well as reflective. It would also be great if it was reasonably priced. I mean, I am not the only runner who is looking for this piece, right? I looked online and that's when it hit me. I’ll never know until I touch the jacket or try it on if it is the right one. Clothes are so subjective and when buying a jacket that is more than $50, I know I won’t be able to make a decision until I have it in my hands.

Once the internet wore me down, I went to a sporting goods store and looked through all the top brands to find a combination of 2 of my requirements, but nothing satisfied all 3. To confess, I did go on Black Friday which was a mistake since I hate crowds so I probably didn’t take an adequate amount time to look through everything. I’ll continue my search and update when that day comes!

Lessons learned: Don’t go shopping for something so specific on Black Friday without reviewing what the store has first (DUH!).

So there are my 4 things. I know I'll find more as the training goes on, but beyond the frustration is my love for running and trying new things.
