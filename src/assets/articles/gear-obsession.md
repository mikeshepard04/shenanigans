# My Running Gear Obsession.

So let me start with saying – I am cheap. I don’t like paying full price for things and I don’t like spending crazy amounts of money on items that aren’t essential. Now that I have been running seriously for 3 years, things have changed. I used to run with $30 headphones, now I am have upgraded to $100 ones. I would find my running gear at TJ Maxx or on clearance at Target and Old Navy, now I have spent $80 on a shirt to run in the winter. Anyone who runs marathons knows those are not cheap. I am talking $200 for a race where in the end you get a shirt, medal, banana and the greatest feeling in the world. What I am trying to say is I am cheap, but when it comes to running an my gear, I look at all my options and pick what will stick with me for the long run.

#### 1.	Headphones. 
As I said, I purchased $30 headphones back in 2014 when I started training for my first half marathon, they were ok, but did the job. In 2016 those headphones broke, yes you get what you pay for. So I went out and bought a different brand, but still $30 headphones. Within the first five times of me using them, one of the earphones went out. I used those into 2018 until the other side gave out. Now after two sets of headphones, I did my research. My main wants were: Must be Bluetooth, decent sound quality, water resistant, and not noise canceling. You read correctly, not noise canceling. As a female runner, I want to hear my surroundings, but still be able to listen to a podcast, music, or book while getting those miles in. I ended up with [Trekz Titanium by Aftershokz](https://aftershokz.com/collections/all/products/trekz-titanium). I have been running with them for 2 months now and now they're an essential piece in my gear inventory.

#### 2.	Shoes.
Ok so shoes are more essential, but I still want to include them in my list because they are still classified as “gear”. I used to run in all different brands to see what worked best for me at the time. My 2018 marathon and half marathon races left me with some terrible foot pain. To be fair, the foot pain came from a bunion and not the shoes. I want to do anything but have surgery. I mean, doesn’t my foot know I have big plans for 2019/ 2020? So I went to Fleet Feet and tried on several shoes I was interested in and then I tried on [Cloud by On](https://www.on-running.com/en-us/products/cloud-coral-pacific-w). They come with elastic laces as well as regular shoelaces. I use the elastic laces, they are perfect and allow me to wear thick wool socks in the winter and regular socks when I go to the gym. Since I started running with them back in November 2018, I have fallen in love and had almost no foot pain!

#### 3.	Winter Weather Gear.
As you have read from my previous posts, finding winter running gear wasn’t going so well. I did my research and found an amazing [blog](https://tinamuir.com/winter-running-what-to-wear-at-every-temperature/) by Tina Muir on what to wear at every temperature. She mentions some brands specifically and I have to say this post was perfectly done. She mentions the [Lululemon Swiftly Tech Long Sleeve Crew](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/tops-long-sleeve/Run-Swiftly-Long-Sleeve-Crew/_/prod8780007?color=0572). After I ran in this one time I was hooked. It kept me warm even when drenched in sweat and it doesn’t smell terrible after my long runs. 

Another item I am obsessed with are my [winter socks](https://www.rei.com/product/118955/rei-co-op-merino-wool-lightweight-hiking-quarter-socks) from REI. I didn’t find these in a blog, I just ended up wearing my camping socks on a run and knew what I wanted for Christmas – more of these socks! They are light weight and when my feet get wet from snow or sweat they are still warm.

#### 4.	Watch.
Since 2015 I have had a Fitbit. I started with the Charge HR and now have the Blaze. Unfortunately, Fitbit no longer sells the Blaze and is now selling the Versa, which has some new features and looks a bit fancier. Right now, I am still in love with the Blaze and it does everything I need, but I think once this one dies I’ll do another review of devices and see what makes sense for my next watch. I do have to say Fitbit as a company has excellent customer service and do make great products. I know many runners use Garmin, but I think Fitbit watches are cost effective and have great features. 

I hope this short list is helpful to someone making those tough gear decisions!

As February is quickly approaching, so is my next marathon. I will be running the Death Valley Marathon on February 2nd, 2019 and I am so excited. My first winter training has been an interesting process. I have done 16-mile runs on a treadmill, 20 mile runs in the snow, and I will prefer the snow run over that much time on a treadmill any day.

My next post will be my Death Valley Marathon experience which I cannot wait to share!
