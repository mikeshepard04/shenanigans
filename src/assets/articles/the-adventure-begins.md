## The Adventure Begins

### Where do I start?

Starting a blog seems impossible. Today there are so many out there and the topics stretch from cooking, traveling, exercise, and the list goes on. Now officially starting one I am asking myself: Where do I start? and What makes me interesting where people would care to read the words I am typing right now? 

Well I am going to start off with a cliff note version of my life and who I am. I am Katie a born and raised Iowa girl. Went to the best school in the world (Iowa State University). I work as a technology consultant for an accounting firm in down town Des Moines, Iowa and I travel A LOT for work. Outside of my working life, I have a wonderful handy husband, Michael, and two wonderful cats, Norman and Stella.

What makes me interesting is another question I would prefer not to answer, but I think if you decide to write a blog, you have to. So, here goes nothing..

First, I am a runner. I run all the races and usually by myself. I wish I could find that awesome running partner, but it hasn’t happened yet so I train and run races by myself. You might be asking yourself, why does that make me interesting? Well, keeping yourself motivated is really hard when you train and sign up for a race alone! Think if you were to sign up for a marathon with no one. 26.2 miles, 4 + hours of 1 on 1 time with no one holding you accountable? How do you stay motivated? Seems really hard, but I have done this 3 times and have signed up for 2 more in 2019! That being said I will be gushing about my training and these wonderful races!

Second, I love to camp and travel worlds greatest treasures, National Parks. I plan to share my husbands amazing photos and our wonderful experiences traveling and prepping for camping. An added bonus to these trips is that they are cheap!

Third, we own a house. Anyone who is looking to buy or has purchased a house understands how these projects go. Something unexpected happens: it take 4 times longer than expected and then your spent $300 more than you thought. Our house is a fixer upper and we have already done many things to make it feel like home, but we like to get our hands dirty and get things done. So I look forward to sharing our fixes/ struggles as we continue to make our house a home.

Fourth, I travel a lot for work. How do I get my workouts in while traveling? How do I deal with long layovers or getting stuck at the airport? Or completely missing your flight because you over slept? Yes, many of these things have happened to me and I’m here to share them with you.

Those are just a few things that I think make me interesting. My next post will be about How to train in the winter for a Marathon. I will be running the Death Valley Marathon on February 2nd, 2019 (remember how I said I love to run and National Parks?). So let the training begin and look forward to sharing how I will be training in Iowa over the winter!
